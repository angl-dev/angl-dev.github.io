        abstract = {Accurate timing characterization of FPGA routing resources, i.e. wires and switches, is critical to achieving high quality of results from FPGA routing tools. Although the composition and connectivity of the routing resources are easily extracted from an FPGA's architecture, post-layout timing characterization of the FPGA's wires and switches (NOT the design being mapped onto the FPGA) with EDA tools is a challenging task due to the large quantity of combinational loops (cycles in the routing graph). Likewise, the use of EDA tools is severely limited when constructing new FPGA architectures. This work addresses the challenge by proposing an algorithm to construct cycle-free FPGA routing graphs. A cycle-free FPGA routing graph is achieved by logically ordering wires and intelligently removing or rearranging a small fraction of the switch block connections in order to break cycles. The proposed approach enables constraining the timing of all routing resources, which is otherwise impossible due to the combinational loops. This technique can be applied to post-layout static timing analysis (STA) of existing FPGAs, significantly reducing the complexity and improving the accuracy of the analysis. In addition, this cycle-free approach can be adopted when designing new FPGAs, transforming costly hand layout into an automated step compatible with commercial ASIC EDA tools.},

        abstract = {Heterogeneous architectures and heterogeneous-ISA designs are growing areas of computer architecture and system software research. Unfortunately, this line of research is significantly hindered by the lack of experimental systems and modifiable hardware frameworks. This work proposes BYOC, a "Bring Your Own Core" framework that is specifically designed to enable heterogeneous-ISA and heterogeneous system research. BYOC is an open-source hardware framework that provides a scalable cache coherence system, that includes out-of-the-box support for four different ISAs (RISC-V 32-bit, RISC-V 64-bit, x86, and SPARCv9) and has been connected to ten different cores. The framework also supports multiple loosely coupled accelerators and is a fully working system supporting SMP Linux. The Transaction-Response Interface (TRI) introduced with BYOC has been specifically designed to make it easy to add in new cores with new ISAs and memory interfaces. This work demonstrates multiple multi-ISA designs running on FPGA and characterises the communication costs. This work describes many of the architectural design trade-offs for building such a flexible system. BYOC is well suited to be the premiere platform for heterogeneous-ISA architecture, system software, and compiler research.},

        abstract = {Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) are being used in a fast-growing range of scenarios, and heterogeneous CPU-FPGA systems are being tapped as a possible way to mitigate the challenges posed by the end of Moore's Law. This growth in diverse use cases has fueled the need to customize FPGA architectures for particular applications or application domains. While high-level FPGA models can help explore the FPGA architecture space, as FPGAs move to more advanced design nodes, there is an increased need for low-level FPGA research and prototyping platforms that can be brought all the way to fabrication.This paper presents Princeton Reconfigurable Gate Array (PRGA), a highly customizable, scalable, and complete open-source framework for building custom FPGAs. The framework's core functions include generating synthesizable Verilog from user-specified FPGA architectures, and providing a complete, auto-generated, open-source CAD toolchain for the custom FPGAs. Developed in Python, PRGA provides a user-friendly API and supports use both as a standalone FPGA as well as an embedded FPGA. PRGA is a great platform for FPGA architecture research, FPGA configuration memory research, FPGA CAD tool research, and heterogeneous systems research. It is also a completely open-source framework for designers who need a free and customizable FPGA IP core. An FPGA designed with PRGA is placed and routed using standard cell libraries. The design is evaluated and compared to prior works, providing comparable performance and increased configurability.},
